# SpotifyTwin - Music Web Player


**SpotifyTwin** is a web-based music player built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that replicates the Spotify experience. It allows users to browse music albums, play and pause songs, and control playback with an interactive interface. With features like volume control, seekbar, and album art display, this app delivers a smooth, user-friendly music experience. It is designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

**Important Note:** The app relies on local APIs to load songs and albums. As a result, some songs and albums may not load properly when hosted without local API support.



## Features
- **Album Browsing**: Browse through music albums and view album art.
- **Play/Pause Music**: Play and pause songs with a simple button click.
- **Seekbar**: Navigate through the song timeline with a draggable seekbar.
- **Volume Control**: Adjust music volume with a slider and mute functionality.
- **Previous/Next Track**: Switch between tracks with previous and next buttons.
- **Song Info**: Display song title and progress.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly and desktop-compatible layout.
- **Local API Integration**: Loads music and album information from local APIs (requires local server for full functionality).
